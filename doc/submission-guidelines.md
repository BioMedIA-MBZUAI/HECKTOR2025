## Submitting Docker Container <a name="submitting_docker"></a>


Assuming you have a verified Grand-Challenge account and have already registered for the HECKTOR challenge, you need to do two main steps to submit your algorithm to the challenge. First, you need to [upload the algorithm](#uplaod-your-algorithm) docker container to the Grand-Challenge platform. Then, you can follow the steps to [submit that algorithm](#submit-your-algorithm) to compete in any leaderboard or phases of the challenge. But before you proceed, make sure that you have read and understood the [participation policies](https://hecktor25.grand-challenge.org/participation-policies/).

### 1- Upload your algorithm <a name="uplaod-your-algorithm"></a>
> **IMPORTANT:** It is crucial to know that you have to submit different algorithms for different tasks of the challenge. Even if you are using the same method for all tasks, you have to upload your algorithm again because the Input and Output configurations for each tasks are different.

In order to submit your algorithm, you first have to add it to the Grand-Challenge platform. To do so, you have to follow the following steps: 

- First, navigate to the [algorithm submission webpage](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/) and click on the "+ Add new algorithm" botttom:

</p> 

- Then you will be directed to the "Create Algorithm" page where you have to choose the phase for which you are creating an algorithm using a drop-down list. Select the phase and click on "Create an Algorithm for this Phase". For more details on different phases, please click [here](#different_phases)

- The next step is to enter the the **Title** and **Job Description** for the algorithm.

</p> 

> **NOTE:** Since you can only create a limited number of algorithms, please make the title of your algorithm meaningful and avoid titles that include the words "test", "debug" etc. In principle you will only need to create 1 algorithm for this phase. Once created, you can upload new container images for it as you improve your code and even switch back to older container images as you see fit.


- After successful creation of an algorithm, you have to connect the docker container. Now, before you can use this algorithm for a challenge submission, you have to assign/upload your dockerized algorithm to it. To do so, click on the "Containers" tab from the left menu.

- There are two ways for uploading the containers. Either you need to link your algorithm to a **GitHub** repo and create a new tag, or upload a valid algorithm container image.

- To upload a container, please make sure the file is in ```.tar.gz``` format produced from the command ```docker save IMAGE | gzip -c > IMAGE.tar.gz```. For more details, please see how to [save the container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/). 

- The input/output for a container is also provided which determines what kind of input/outputs files are expected/generated by a container for each task. For more details on the specific format, you can click on the ℹ️ icon.

- Once you have uploaded your docker container, click on the **Save** button given below and your algorithm will be completed and ready to be submitted to the challenge. Remember, the algorithm is only ready to submit when the status badge in front of the upload description changes to **Active**.
